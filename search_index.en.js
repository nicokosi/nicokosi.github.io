Quoting The Pragmatic Programmer :\n\nInvest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio\n\nMy last project \"for learning\" was to create a command-line tool, named hubstats, that outputs a summary for pull requests GitHub. This tool aims at giving some metrics for me and my team.\nThe real purposes were to practice Clojure (which I knew little) but also to discover REST and GraphQL GitHub APIs.\nMoreover, I was lucky to interact with a colleague of mine who is an advanced Clojure developer. That was really cool, thanks Jérôme aka @jprudent!\n\n## What is _hubstats_?\nhubstats is a simple command line tool that outputs, for a given GitHub repository, the number of opened/commented/merged pull requests by author for a given period (last week, since a given date, etc.).\nHere is an output example:\n\n\n## How does it work?\nI have chosen Clojure, a language that is different from the language that I use every day (Java).\nThe following characteristics appealed to me:\n\ndynamic and interactive development: code is short and simple, which seems cool for an internal tool; what's more, the REPL is a base tool that greatly fit to a discovery mindset.\nfunctional programming: functions are first-class citizen, immutability and function recursion are basics\nLisp: Clojure is a Lisp, so writing code is a bit different from C-like languages ; Code is data and can be edited via paredit (emacs-like mode for editing code while keeping parentheses balanced).\nsimplicity: Clojure encourages too use small libraries instead of huge frameworks.\n\nSee Clojure Rationale.\nMy dev setup:\n\nIntelliJ IDEA with Cursive plugin\nCursive paredit mode\nLeiningen as build tool\nTravis CI for continuous integration\n\n\n## So what?\nWhat I liked:\n\na \"parenthesis\" (haha!) with my daily Java routines/habits\nparedit is confusing at first, then pleasant to use\nREPL rocks for\n\nshaping code (acts as a draft for new code)\ntroubleshooting bugs (example: incorrect GitHub pagination traversing that led to out-of-memory crash)\n\n\nunit tests are easy to write (example: with-redefs macro can be used to mock functions: https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/with-redefs)\n\nWhat I did not like:\n\nWTFs when runtime bugs occurred (obscure stack traces)\nintegrated documentation lacks examples.

Hubstats is a command line tool I wrote in Clojure that calls GitHub API and displays pull requests summaries in the standard output. I just converted this project in Rust: pullpito.\nPorting existing code was an enjoyable way to learn Rust since I did not had to think about the \"what\" (display pull requests information) and the \"how\" (call the GitHub API): I just had to focus on Rust coding!\nMy first impressions\nRust code runs fast! For instance, let's compare running a few pullpito's unit tests that run in half a second:\n\nOn the other hand, hubstats' tests run in 10 seconds:\n\nNote: the cargo command launches Cargo which is Rust's build tool ; the lein command launches Leiningen which is Clojure's build tool.\nNow let's compare the CLI tool executions. pullpito runs in 20 milliseconds:\n\n...whereas hubstats runs in 11 seconds (it should probably be optimized 😇):\n\nWhat about compilation? The first compilation is slow because all dependencies have to be compiled. For instance, pullpito initially compiles in 40 seconds, on my machine:\n\nBut Rust has an incremental compiler, so subsequent compilations will be immediate if code does not change:\n\nOn the other hand, hubstats compiles in 40 seconds (dependencies are not compiled):\n\n\n## About Rust, the language\n\n### Ownership, OMG! 😱\nRust has a particular way to manage memory. Instead of using a garbage collector like Java or manual management like C/C++, allocated memory is automatically cleaned using the \"ownership\" rules:\n\nIt seems easy, but in reality, all the implications are hard to understand!\nSince I have not fully understood the ownership implications, I will not go any further on this topic. My current status is: fix all the compilation errors! 😇\nFeel free to read more about it in the chapter \"Understanding Ownership\" of \"The Rust Programming Language\".\n\n### Immutability by default 😎\nA variable is immutable, by default. It cannot be re-assigned unless explicitly declared mutable:\n\nHowever, immutable variables can be shadowed:\n\n\n### Type inference 😎\nType inference is great for conciseness:\n```rust\n// Type can be inferred:\nlet foo = \"foo\".to_string();\n// or set explicitly:\nlet foo : String = \"foo\".to_string();\n```\n\n### Pattern matching 😎\nRust has pattern matching... and it's cool!\n\nAs far as I understand, variable borrowing makes pattern matching harder to use, as seen in the Stack Overflow. Note to self: try this out.\n\n### Tuples, enums and structures 😎\nRust has enums, tuples, and structures:\n\nLet's test it via the rusti REPL:\n\n\n## Rust tooling\n\n### No REPL (with full Rust support) 😢\nThere is no official REPL (Read Eval Print Loop), and that's a pity for beginners like me!\nrusti can help but does not support all recent language changes.\nOn-line REPLs such as repl.it can also be handy, even if limited (e.g. cannot import external dependencies aka crates).\nConcise dependency descriptors (Cargo.toml) with semantic versioning 😎\nEvery cargo binary (aka crate):\n\nhas a descriptor with a semantic version. For instance, pullpito's version is 0.1.0, as declared in its Cargo.toml descriptor:\n\n\n\ndeclares the versions of its own dependencies:\n\n\nCool and concise, isn't it?\n\n### Standard code format 😎\nrustfmt can be used as a command-line tool to format code using a default style:\n\nNo more \"tabs vs space vs ...\" flame war! Cf. https://xkcd.com/1285/!\n\n### User-friendly compiler (mostly) 😎\nThe Rust compiler often makes useful suggestions in case of compilation error. Example:\n\nwill fail compiling:\n\n\n### A multi-version toolchain: `rustup` 😎\nRust has three release channels: stable, beta, and nightly. You can natively install and use one, some or all of them. Indeed, some libraries or tools may only work on the \"stable\" toolchain, and others may require the \"nightly\" one. In that case, use the rustup command to install and use both toolchains.\nFor instance, I can install the nightly toolchain:\n\nThere are now two toolchains: stable and nightly:\n\nI can then:\n\nchange the default toolchain via rustup default\nset the active toolchain via rustup set\nuse it on demand via rustup run $toolchain $cmd (example: rustup run nightly cargo build)\n\netc.\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/discovering-rust/","title":"Discovering Rust"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/explore-strava-activities-with-kibana-2/":{"body":"Exploring my own Strava activities using Kibana (part 2): a better dashboard\nAssumed audience: people interested in data exploration.\nPlease read the first part on this article about the Kibana setup and Strava data injection.\nMy colleague Franck gave me a cool Kibana tip: try the \"vertical bar\" with a \"count\" operator.\nIn order to give it a try, I created a dashboard with the following charts:\n\n\n\"average speed histogram\", using a Vertical bar chart: Y-axis is \"average(average_speed)\", X-axis is \"@timestamp\" and Split series on \"type\".\n\n\n\"count activities by type\", using a Metric chart, using Aggregation \"Count\" and Split group on \"type\".\n\n\n\"distance histogram\", using a Vertical bar chart: Y-axis is \"average(distance)\", X-axis is \"@timestamp\" and split series on \"type\".\n\n\n\"activity type tree map\", using a Treemap chart with Group by \"type.\n\n\n\"counts per day\" using a Bar vertical chart with horizontal axis on \"start_date\", vertical axis on \"Count of records\" and break down by \"top values of type\".\n\n\nHere is a preview of the final dashboard: 🎉\n.\nThe same dashboard when clicking on \"Run\" activity type:\n.\nThe dashboard with its charts can be imported via the upper left button / \"Management\" / \"Stack Management\" / \"Saved Objects\" / \"Import\" with this file.\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/explore-strava-activities-with-kibana-2/","title":"Exploring my own Strava activities using Kibana (part 2): a better dashboard"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/explore-strava-activities-with-kibana/":{"body":"Exploring my own Strava activities using Kibana\nAssumed audience: people interested in data exploration.\nI use strava.com to track my running/hike activities since a few years.

My plan was to implement a CLI tool for displaying information on GitHub pull requests. I thus created a small project in GitHub: pullpigo, in order to display event counters about GitHub pull requests via GitHub's public API.\nNote that I have already implemented this CLI tool in other programming languages that I wanted to learn: in Clojure (see hubstats), Kotlin (see pullpitoK) and Rust (see pullpito).\nNative executables are fast 🚀\nLet's compile pullpigo:\n\nThen run it:\n\nNow compare these build &amp; run times with a similar Kotlin project (pullpitoK):\n\nFast compilation + fast runtime = ❤️\nGolang SDK already includes many common utilities 📦\nIn order to call GitHub's REST API v3 'events' API, all I needed was: a HTTP client, a JSON parser and a test framework. Good news, all are included in the Golang SDK: testing, HTTP client and JSON parsing.\nAs a consequence, I implemented my project with zero dependencies!\nOther goodies have I appreciated from by Java background:\n\n\ncode formatting is included! Its' simple as go fmt. No need to find and configure an external code formatting tools.\n\n\ncode linter is included! Just install golang/linttype and run the golint command. No need to find and configure an external code formatting tools (to be honest, the linter did not help when coding pullpigo but it's so cool that code linter is provided).\n[Edit from 2024-12-30: golang/linttype does not exists anymore, other tools like go vet exist).\n\n\nOther opportunities 😎\nCoding this small hobby project has also been an opportunity to try and learn other tools. In my case, I could:\n\n\nUse Visual Studio Code, an Integrated Development Environment that I don't use at work.\n\n\nUse GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration: every git commit pushed on GitHub triggers a compilation &amp; test check. It was the first time I used GitHub Actions, it was very easy (it only took a few minutes) to use it for my needs, and it's free.\n\n\nThe last positive thing about learning a programming language is that you can discuss and learn with people you know.\nIn my case, my \"Golang friends\" have been:\n\n\nJean-Christophe who helped me to fix my JSON parsing issues. 😅\n\n\nFlorent who gave me pointers on cool libraries: testing/quick for property-based testing, ginkgo for BDD-style tests and gomega for test assertions. I have to try them out! 😎\n\n\nWhat's next? 🔮\nSome ideas:\n\n\nMake pullpigo's output more useful. For example, I could make it display counters for events like \"pull request created\", \"pull request merged\" etc.\n\n\nRetrieve data from GitHub's GraphQL API v4 in order to by-pass the limitation of number of events (GitHub's REST API v3 'events' API only returns the last 300 events).\n\n\nUse some dependencies for testing (easier assertions, property-based-testing etc.) and take this opportunity to discover dependencies in Golang.\n\n\nWe'll see!\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/rediscovering-golang-with-pullpigo/","title":"Rediscovering Golang with \"pullpigo\", a small hobby-project"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/scala-pattern-matching/":{"body":"Let's play with pattern matching in Scala\nPattern matching is a powerful technique for filtering and testing variables. This article aims at illustrating pattern matching in Scala using a simple example.\nLet's say we want to return the color (red or black) of a playing card.\nNotes: The code below \"shows\" the console output using comments (ex: \"foo\" // foo). I have used a IntelliJ IDEA worksheet but the standard Scala console can also be used (REPL FTW!)\n\n## Step #1: let's create a simple class\nLet's create a immutable class for the \"club\" suite:\n\nSo far, so good. Instances can be compared by identity (reference) but not by value because we did not override the equals method:\n\nhashCode and toString are also default ones:\n\n\n## Step #2: let's create a case class\nA case class has two benefits:\n\nauto-implement equals, hashCode and toString methods.\nenhance pattern matching capability via two methods: a \"constructor\" method, apply, and a \"de-constructor\" method, unapply.\n\n\napply method is a kind of free constructor. By the way, we don't need to use the new keyword:\n\nequals, hashCode and toString methods are also implemented for free:\n\n\n## \"Bonus\" step: use an enumeration\nSince there are four suites in French playing cards, we can create an enumeration. This is not directly related to our pattern matching example, but let's do it, for fun and profit. ;-)\n\n\n## Last step: let's use pattern matching!\nFirst example\nHere is a first pattern matching example, used in a function that returns the color of a suite card:\n\nThis example demonstrates:\n\nthe | notation (disjunction) that can be used to group several cases;\nthe _ notation (wildcard) for \"other cases\".\n\nSecond example\nHere is a second example to demonstrate field filtering, also known as \"de-structuring\":\n\nWe only keep the suite label using the unapply method of our case class.\nThat's all folks! 🤓\nPS: Thanks to Jérôme Prudent for the Scala tips and for the review.
