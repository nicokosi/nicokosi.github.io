Quoting The Pragmatic Programmer :\n\nInvest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio\n\nMy last project \"for learning\" was to create a command-line tool, named hubstats, that outputs a summary for pull requests GitHub. This tool aims at giving some metrics for me and my team.\nThe real purposes were to practice Clojure (which I knew little) but also to discover REST and GraphQL GitHub APIs.\nMoreover, I was lucky to interact with a colleague of mine who is an advanced Clojure developer. That was really cool, thanks Jérôme aka @jprudent!\n\n## What is _hubstats_?\nhubstats is a simple command line tool that outputs, for a given GitHub repository, the number of opened/commented/merged pull requests by author for a given period (last week, since a given date, etc.).\nHere is an output example:\n\n\n## How does it work?\nI have chosen Clojure, a language that is different from the language that I use every day (Java).\nThe following characteristics appealed to me:\n\ndynamic and interactive development: code is short and simple, which seems cool for an internal tool; what's more, the REPL is a base tool that greatly fit to a discovery mindset.\nfunctional programming: functions are first-class citizen, immutability and function recursion are basics\nLisp: Clojure is a Lisp, so writing code is a bit different from C-like languages ; Code is data and can be edited via paredit (emacs-like mode for editing code while keeping parentheses balanced).\nsimplicity: Clojure encourages too use small libraries instead of huge frameworks.\n\nSee Clojure Rationale.\nMy dev setup:\n\nIntelliJ IDEA with Cursive plugin\nCursive paredit mode\nLeiningen as build tool\nTravis CI for continuous integration\n\n\n## So what?\nWhat I liked:\n\na \"parenthesis\" (haha!) with my daily Java routines/habits\nparedit is confusing at first, then pleasant to use\nREPL rocks for\n\nshaping code (acts as a draft for new code)\ntroubleshooting bugs (example: incorrect GitHub pagination traversing that led to out-of-memory crash)\n\n\nunit tests are easy to write (example: with-redefs macro can be used to mock functions: https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/with-redefs)\n\nWhat I did not like:\n\nWTFs when runtime bugs occurred (obscure stack traces)\nintegrated documentation lacks examples. I often had to browse Clojure Docs to understand Clojure base functions via useful examples.\n\n\n## What's next?\nSome ideas for some evolutions (or an other project, maybe?):\n\nuse GitHub GraphQL\nmake a web app for hubstats (via ClojureScript?)\nbuild another CLI tool\nlearn another language (for example: Go or Rust)\n\n[edit from 2024-12-30: GitHub GraphQL link has been updated]\nThat's all folk! 😉\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/discover-github-apis-with-clojure/","title":"Discovering GitHub APIs while learning Clojure"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/discovering-rust/":{"body":"Discovering Rust\nAs a Java developer, I want to learn bits of Rust, so that I can deeply understand this sentence quoted from rust-lang.org*:\n\nRust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety\n\n*: did you notice the \"agile stories meme\"? 😉\nHow I started learning Rust\nThe Rust Programming Language (2nd edition) is a great free on-line book with pragmatic examples and small projects that are progressively implemented (a CLI tool and a web server).\nAfter reading parts of this book, I ported a personal project named hubstats from Clojure to Rust. Hubstats is a command line tool I wrote in Clojure that calls GitHub API and displays pull requests summaries in the standard output. I just converted this project in Rust: pullpito.\nPorting existing code was an enjoyable way to learn Rust since I did not had to think about the \"what\" (display pull requests information) and the \"how\" (call the GitHub API): I just had to focus on Rust coding!\nMy first impressions\nRust code runs fast! For instance, let's compare running a few pullpito's unit tests that run in half a second:\n\nOn the other hand, hubstats' tests run in 10 seconds:\n\nNote: the cargo command launches Cargo which is Rust's build tool ; the lein command launches Leiningen which is Clojure's build tool.\nNow let's compare the CLI tool executions. pullpito runs in 20 milliseconds:\n\n...whereas hubstats runs in 11 seconds (it should probably be optimized 😇):\n\nWhat about compilation? The first compilation is slow because all dependencies have to be compiled. For instance, pullpito initially compiles in 40 seconds, on my machine:\n\nBut Rust has an incremental compiler, so subsequent compilations will be immediate if code does not change:\n\nOn the other hand, hubstats compiles in 40 seconds (dependencies are not compiled):\n\n\n## About Rust, the language\n\n### Ownership, OMG! 😱\nRust has a particular way to manage memory. Instead of using a garbage collector like Java or manual management like C/C++, allocated memory is automatically cleaned using the \"ownership\" rules:\n\nIt seems easy, but in reality, all the implications are hard to understand!\nSince I have not fully understood the ownership implications, I will not go any further on this topic. My current status is: fix all the compilation errors! 😇\nFeel free to read more about it in the chapter \"Understanding Ownership\" of \"The Rust Programming Language\".\n\n### Immutability by default 😎\nA variable is immutable, by default. It cannot be re-assigned unless explicitly declared mutable:\n\nHowever, immutable variables can be shadowed:\n\n\n### Type inference 😎\nType inference is great for conciseness:\n```rust\n// Type can be inferred:\nlet foo = \"foo\".to_string();\n// or set explicitly:\nlet foo : String = \"foo\".to_string();\n```\n\n### Pattern matching 😎\nRust has pattern matching... and it's cool!\n\nAs far as I understand, variable borrowing makes pattern matching harder to use, as seen in the Stack Overflow. Note to self: try this out.\n\n### Tuples, enums and structures 😎\nRust has enums, tuples, and structures:\n\nLet's test it via the rusti REPL:\n\n\n## Rust tooling\n\n### No REPL (with full Rust support) 😢\nThere is no official REPL (Read Eval Print Loop), and that's a pity for beginners like me!\nrusti can help but does not support all recent language changes.\nOn-line REPLs such as repl.it can also be handy, even if limited (e.g. cannot import external dependencies aka crates).\nConcise dependency descriptors (Cargo.toml) with semantic versioning 😎\nEvery cargo binary (aka crate):\n\nhas a descriptor with a semantic version. For instance, pullpito's version is 0.1.0, as declared in its Cargo.toml descriptor:\n\n\n\ndeclares the versions of its own dependencies:\n\n\nCool and concise, isn't it?\n\n### Standard code format 😎\nrustfmt can be used as a command-line tool to format code using a default style:\n\nNo more \"tabs vs space vs ...\" flame war! Cf. https://xkcd.com/1285/!\n\n### User-friendly compiler (mostly) 😎\nThe Rust compiler often makes useful suggestions in case of compilation error. Example:\n\nwill fail compiling:\n\n\n### A multi-version toolchain: `rustup` 😎\nRust has three release channels: stable, beta, and nightly. You can natively install and use one, some or all of them. Indeed, some libraries or tools may only work on the \"stable\" toolchain, and others may require the \"nightly\" one. In that case, use the rustup command to install and use both toolchains.\nFor instance, I can install the nightly toolchain:\n\nThere are now two toolchains: stable and nightly:\n\nI can then:\n\nchange the default toolchain via rustup default\nset the active toolchain via rustup set\nuse it on demand via rustup run $toolchain $cmd (example: rustup run nightly cargo build)\n\netc.\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/discovering-rust/","title":"Discovering Rust"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/explore-strava-activities-with-kibana-2/":{"body":"Exploring my own Strava activities using Kibana (part 2): a better dashboard\nAssumed audience: people interested in data exploration.\nPlease read the first part on this article about the Kibana setup and Strava data injection.\nMy colleague Franck gave me a cool Kibana tip: try the \"vertical bar\" with a \"count\" operator.\nIn order to give it a try, I created a dashboard with the following charts:\n\n\n\"average speed histogram\", using a Vertical bar chart: Y-axis is \"average(average_speed)\", X-axis is \"@timestamp\" and Split series on \"type\".\n\n\n\"count activities by type\", using a Metric chart, using Aggregation \"Count\" and Split group on \"type\".\n\n\n\"distance histogram\", using a Vertical bar chart: Y-axis is \"average(distance)\", X-axis is \"@timestamp\" and split series on \"type\".\n\n\n\"activity type tree map\", using a Treemap chart with Group by \"type.\n\n\n\"counts per day\" using a Bar vertical chart with horizontal axis on \"start_date\", vertical axis on \"Count of records\" and break down by \"top values of type\".\n\n\nHere is a preview of the final dashboard: 🎉\n.\nThe same dashboard when clicking on \"Run\" activity type:\n.\nThe dashboard with its charts can be imported via the upper left button / \"Management\" / \"Stack Management\" / \"Saved Objects\" / \"Import\" with this file.\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/explore-strava-activities-with-kibana-2/","title":"Exploring my own Strava activities using Kibana (part 2): a better dashboard"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/explore-strava-activities-with-kibana/":{"body":"Exploring my own Strava activities using Kibana\nAssumed audience: people interested in data exploration.\nI use strava.com to track my running/hike activities since a few years.

It takes 2 seconds on my machine:\n\nNote that the ellapsed time is at the end of the last line, in seconds: 2.022 total means 2.022 seconds.\nNow generate an executable via GraalVM native-image. It takes 42 seconds on my machine:\n\nLet's compare the runtime durations for a small input file:\n\n\nAnd the memory footprints:\n\nNote that the amount of allocated memory is at the end of the last line, in bytes: 49,960,719 allocated means that 50 megabytes have been allocated.\n\nTo sum up, at the cost of a longer compilation (42 seconds instead of 2 seconds), GraalVM:\n\nspeeds up our application: 7 milliseconds instead of 118 milliseconds ;\nreduces the memory footprint: 12 kilobytes instead of 50 megabytes.\n\nAn optimized executable for a Kotlin CLI tool\nNow let's generate an executable for a Kotlin CLI tool, pullpitoK (200 lines of code, with third-party libraries) that calls GitHub API to display information on GitHub pull requests.\nThe cost of compilation is similar, so let's focus on comparing the runtime behavior for a short execution (we will display the \"usage message\"):\n\n\nSo, 9 milliseconds for the native version versus 93 milliseconds for the JVM version.\nNow let's compare the memory footprints:\n\n\nSo, 2 kilobytes for the native version versus 33 megabytes for the JVM version.\nAn \"not-fully optimized\" executable for a Clojure CLI tool\nWhen I wrote my previous article Clojure goes native with GraalVM, GraalVM was still experimental (release candidates). Moreover, I was stuck with the Native Image limitations with dynamic class loading, the refection API (java.lang.reflect).\n[edit from 2024-12-30: Native Image limitations link was broken has been removed]\nLet's try again with GraalVM release for a Clojure CLI tool: hubstats (200 lines of code, with third-party libraries).\n\nNative compilation fails:\n\nWe could probably change the source code to fix this issue. As quick fix, let's try the fallback mode that embeds a classic virtual machine:\n\nWith the fallback mode, duration times are similar since the startup time cannot be reduced in the native mode:\n\n\nbut the memory footprint of the executable is still reduced:\n\n\nConclusion\nWith these three small applications implemented with distinct JVM languages (Java, Kotlin and Clojure), we have checked some values of GraalVM native images:\n\ncompact executables that can be deployed without a Java Virtual Machine\nsmall memory footprints\nfast startup (sometimes!).\n\nMoreover, we can see that GraalVM will probably modernize Java for the cloud-computing and for micro-services, with the Java Runtime Environment or with frameworks like Quarkus and Micronaut).\nPS: thanks to my colleagues at Vidal, notably Viviane, Marc and Jean-Christophe for the discussions on GraalVM, and Stéphane for reviewing the french version of this article.\n","id":"https://nicokosi.github.io/java-clojure-and-kotlin-go-native-with-graalvm/","title":"Java, Kotlin and Clojure go native with GraalVM"},"https://nicokosi.github.io/nix-terminal-tricks/":{"body":"A few \"unix-like\" terminal tricks 🧙\nAssumed audience: developers interested in using the terminal for various tasks.\nAs a developer, I like using shell commands in my terminal.
